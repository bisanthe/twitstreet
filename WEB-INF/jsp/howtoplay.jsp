	<p>Twitstreet is a stock exchange game. But in this game we are
		buying and selling followers of twitter users.</p>
	<p>In this game you will have 10.000$ cash initially. Every
		follower worth 1$.For example Barack Obama has nearly 1 million
		followers on twitter. You can buy 10.000 follower of Barack Obama and
		this equals to %1 of his followers. Let say Obama's follower count
		increased to 2 million during his 2012 election's campaign. So you
		will have 20.000 follower of Obama and your portfolio worth 20.000$.</p>
	<p>Point is, try to find trendy people on twitter. Who will be
		popular on twitter in near future ? And you cannot buy follower of a
		twitter user if it has less than 1000 follower.</p>
	<p>Good luck!</p>
